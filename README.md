Privacy-first Instagram data explorer and insights dashboard. Import your official Instagram export and analyze your activity, ads, connections, messages, security, and more — 100% offline.

## Highlights

- **Offline by design**: Your export stays on your machine. No servers, no external uploads.
- **Rich analysis**: Ads topics, active apps, connections, insights, link history, messages, security events, and more.
- **Beautiful UI**: Built with React + Vite + Material UI, with interactive charts (ECharts/Recharts).
- **Multi-platform**: Desktop (Windows/Linux) and Android builds via Tauri.
- **One-click releases**: CI builds per-ABI APKs and desktop installers, and drafts a pre-release with changelog.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the application running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IRedDragonICY/peeksta.git
    cd peeksta
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2. **Open your browser:**

   Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port specified in the console) to view the application.

## Importing Your Instagram Data

1. Request your data at Instagram Accounts Center → Download your information.
2. Choose JSON format. You will receive a ZIP.
3. In Peeksta, open the Datasets manager and drop the ZIP or extracted directory. Parsing runs locally.

## Project Structure

Key directories:

- `src/`
  - `pages/`: Top-level routes (Overview, Ads, Apps, Connections, Insights, Link History, Logged Information, Messages, Personal, Preferences, Security, Threads).
  - `components/`: Reusable UI and visualization components (charts, panels, tables, layout, sidebar).
  - `ig/`: Instagram data pipeline:
    - `ingestion/`: ZIP and directory ingestion
    - `parsers/`: Activity, ads, connections, insights, logged info, messages, profile, security
    - `analysis.js`: Higher-level analysis helpers
    - `utils/`: file and data utilities
  - `storage/`: Client-side dataset management
  - `materialTheme.js` / `theme/`: Theming

- `src-tauri/`
  - Tauri v2 configuration (`tauri.conf.json`), Rust crate (`Cargo.toml`, `src/`), and build script.

## Technologies

- React 18 + Vite 6
- Material UI, Emotion, Styled Components
- ECharts, Recharts
- JSZip
- Tauri v2 (desktop + Android)

## Desktop & Android

Peeksta ships as a Tauri app. Typical local flows:

Desktop (Windows/Linux):
```bash
npm run tauri:dev      # dev
npm run tauri:build    # production build
```

Android (debug for local testing):
```bash
npm run tauri:android:init
npm run tauri android build -- --apk --split-per-abi
```

Notes:
- You need Rust stable and the platform toolchains required by Tauri.
- For Android: Java 17, Android SDK, and NDK.
- Artifacts produced locally are unsigned; sign before distribution.

## CI/CD

On every push to `main` (or manual dispatch):
- Builds the web app and creates a GitHub pre-release with autogenerated changelog.
- Builds desktop apps: Windows (portable EXE + NSIS/MSI) and Linux (binary, AppImage, Debian package).
- Builds Android artifacts with per-ABI splits (APKs and AABs) and a universal AAB.

Artifacts are named like:
- `peeksta-<version>-android-<abi>.apk`
- `peeksta-<version>-android-<abi>.aab`
- `peeksta-<version>-win-x64.exe`, `peeksta-<version>-win-x64-setup.exe`
- `peeksta-<version>-linux-x64`, `.AppImage`, `.deb`

## Privacy & Security

- All parsing and analysis are local-first. Peeksta does not transmit your data to any server.
- When using packaged apps, data remains on your device; remove datasets anytime from the UI.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Please:
- Keep PRs focused and well-described; link issues when applicable.
- Use conventional commits where practical (feat, fix, perf, docs, chore).
- Run lint/build locally before submitting.
