/*
  Most global styles have been removed from this file as they are now
  managed by MUI's ThemeProvider and CssBaseline.

  MUI's CssBaseline handles:
  - Normalizing box-sizing.
  - Setting body margin to 0.
  - Basic typography settings (font-family, font-size, line-height).
  - Background color and text color based on the theme (light/dark).

  MUI components (like Button, Link) have their own styles that
  respect the theme.

  Specific global overrides or utility classes can still be placed here if needed,
  but prefer using MUI's styling solutions (sx prop, styled-components)
  for component-specific styling.
*/

/* Example of a global style you might keep if not covered by MUI's theme or components: */
/*
a {
  text-decoration: none; // If you want to enforce no underline globally for links
}

a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline; // Example hover effect
}
*/

/* The following were removed as they are handled by MUI or are no longer needed:
   - :root color-scheme, color, background-color, font settings
   - body margin, display, place-items, min-width, min-height
   - h1 default styling (MUI Typography component should be used)
   - button default styling (MUI Button component should be used)
   - @media (prefers-color-scheme) blocks
