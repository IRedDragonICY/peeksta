// This file is intentionally left blank.
// The GlobalStyles component defined here using styled-components
// is no longer used in the application.
//
// Its previous responsibilities (like setting global font, body background,
// link styles, etc.) are now handled by:
// 1. MUI's <CssBaseline /> component.
// 2. The MUI ThemeProvider and the theme object defined in App.jsx,
//    which controls fonts, colors, and other theme aspects.
// 3. Component-level styling using MUI's `sx` prop or `styled()` utility.
//
// The import for GlobalStyles was removed from App.jsx in a previous step.
// Keeping this file empty or deleting it prevents conflicts with MUI's styling.
